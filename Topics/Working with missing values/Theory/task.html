<h2>Working with missing values</h2>

 <body>
  <p>In this topic, you're going to learn the basics about missing values (also called <code class="language-python">NaN</code>s). We will firstly define what is a missing value and for what reasons it occurs. Secondly, we will walk through <code class="language-python">pandas</code> methods to detect and count missing values in the dataset. Then we will learn how to delete <code class="language-python">NaN</code>s using <code class="language-python">pandas</code>.</p> 
  <h5 id="what-is-a-missing-value">What is a missing value?</h5> 
  <p>A missing value is <strong>the absence of data</strong>. It can occur for various reasons. For example, if you have a dataset that contains student's test answers, some of the questions may be skipped by a student. Or some problem may have happened during data collection from a website, so some features weren't recorded. We will use <code class="language-python">pandas</code> to read and process the data. It highlights a missing value as <code class="language-python">NaN</code>, which means "Not a Number".</p>
  <div class="alert alert-primary">
   <code class="language-python">NaN</code>s do not necessarily stand for missing numbers, but for missing strings, dates, or any other data types as well.
  </div>
  <p></p> 
  <p>Why is there a problem with <code class="language-python">NaN</code>s? </p> 
  <p>Firstly, we can only feed data without missing values to a machine learning model. We will catch an error trying to use an unprepared dataset with <code class="language-python">NaN</code>s.</p> 
  <p>Secondly, if a feature contains a lot of missing values (more than 60-70%), it will likely be useless.</p> 
  <p>Nevertheless, sometimes <code class="language-python">NaN</code> occurs for a meaningful reason. For example, there is a dataset with a wide range of various medical tests as features. Usually, doctors do not carry out all possible medical tests, but only those that can help to indicate a suspected disease. So there may be missing values in some fields of the dataset, simply because it wasn't suspected that a patient might have abnormalities in those medical indicators. In this case, the data is not literally "missing", but rather <code class="language-python">NaN</code>s indicate that a patient's missing test values are not relevant to the diagnosis and most likely within a normal range.</p> 
  <p>Therefore, handling missing values is crucial for the data pre-processing stage. Let's start with a simple example:</p> 
  <p><img alt="" src="https://ucarecdn.com/855804f0-47b2-46e9-96aa-a28d31a67eab/"></p> 
  <p>We will use the part of <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/student+performance" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">the dataset</a> about Portuguese pupils:</p> 
  <p><code class="language-python">school</code> is the name of the school;<br> <code class="language-python">age</code> is a pupil's age;<br> <code class="language-python">famsize</code> is the size of a pupil's family ('<code class="language-python">LE3</code>' if less or equal to 3 or '<code class="language-python">GT3</code>' if greater than 3);<br> <code class="language-python">studytime</code> is weekly study time (<code class="language-python">1</code> means less than 2 hours, <code class="language-python">2</code> : 2-5 hours, <code class="language-python">3</code> : 5 to 10 hours, or <code class="language-python">4</code> means greater than 10 hours).</p> 
  <h5 id="how-can-we-find-them">How can we find them?</h5> 
  <p>Let's have a look at several methods in <code class="language-python">pandas</code> that work with the <code class="language-python">NaN</code>s. Our dataset is stored in <code class="language-python">data</code>.</p> 
  <p>1) <code class="language-python">pandas.DataFrame.isnull()</code> to mark which value is <code class="language-python">NaN</code> and which is not</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">data.isnull()</code></pre> 
  <p>It returns <code class="language-python">True</code> if the value is missing, and <code class="language-python">False</code> otherwise:</p> 
  <p><img alt="" src="https://ucarecdn.com/228af35b-7195-4da5-af55-135a2d97a138/-/crop/381x162/47,47/-/preview/"></p> 
  <p>In the screenshot above, the 244th sample has a missing value in the <code class="language-python">school</code>, <code class="language-python">age</code>, and <code class="language-python">studytime</code> fields. At the same time, the 244th doesn't have <code class="language-python">NaN</code> in the <code class="language-python">famsize</code> field.</p> 
  <p>2) A combination of methods to calculate a proportion of <code class="language-python">NaN</code>s per feature:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">data.isnull().sum() / data.shape[0]</code></pre> 
  <p><img alt="" src="https://ucarecdn.com/f7ff73b0-4ee1-4ef9-accc-914800bdde9d/-/crop/357x113/14,37/-/preview/"></p> 
  <p>Let's figure it out step by step. Firstly, <code class="language-python">isnull()</code> marks which value is <code class="language-python">NaN</code> and which is not. Secondly, <code class="language-python">sum()</code> calculates how many <code class="language-python">True</code>s (<code class="language-python">True</code>= NaN) per feature there are. Then, <code class="language-python">/ data.shape[0]</code>divides the number of missing values per feature by the number of rows. Finally, we get a proportion of missing values per column.</p> 
  <p><img alt="" src="https://ucarecdn.com/60122c87-47dd-4e70-8dab-863a5dedac4e/-/crop/1840x669/0,157/-/preview/"></p> 
  <p>3) Finally, this is how we can check whether there are any missing values or not:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">data.isnull().any()</code></pre> 
  <p><img alt="" src="https://ucarecdn.com/6d8f0712-e0fa-4e89-9c9a-b3ca9cff9ae1/-/crop/242x120/43,53/-/preview/"></p> 
  <p>In this case, there are <code class="language-python">NaN</code>s in each column, so we received <code class="language-python">True</code> next to all the features.</p> 
  <h5 id="how-to-deal-with-them">How to deal with them?</h5> 
  <p>As mentioned above, we have to somehow get rid of missing values before training a model. There are many ways to tackle this problem. The simplest one is to delete them.</p> 
  <p>1) We can drop all the rows which contain missing values with <code class="language-python">pandas.DataFrame.dropna(axis=0)</code>:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">data.dropna(axis=0)</code></pre> 
  <p><img alt="" src="https://ucarecdn.com/6bec2b58-796a-4772-b129-8cd613fe259a/"></p> 
  <p>2) We can also drop columns by setting <code class="language-python">axis=1</code>:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">data.dropna(axis=1)</code></pre> 
  <p><img alt="" src="https://ucarecdn.com/1c584ff3-4c03-45d7-a978-92c0cdfa84d4/"></p> 
  <p></p>
  <div class="alert alert-primary">
   In order for the changes to be saved in the original DataFrame set the 
   <code class="language-python">inplace=True</code> parameter.
  </div>

  <p>This topic covers some basics about missing values. It is a good starting point for an exploration of more intelligent ways to deal with <code class="language-python">NaN</code>s. For example, filling <code class="language-python">NaN</code>s with certain values is a popular approach in case we can't just delete the data. This will be discussed in future topics.</p>
