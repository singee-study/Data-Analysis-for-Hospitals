  <p>You are working with a DataFrame <code class="java">df_rock</code> that contains sonar signals. There are two types of signals - the ones from mines and the others from rocks. The first five columns contain waves lengths that got a sonar from different angles. </p> 
  <p>1. Load the data from the .txt file as Pandas DataFrame.</p> 
  <p>2. Calculate mean values for all columns grouped by the label (don't forget about our old friend - <code class="java">pivot_table</code> ).</p> 
  <p>3. Round the mean value for rocks from <code class="java">null_deg</code> column to two decimal places and insert it in the answer field.</p>
